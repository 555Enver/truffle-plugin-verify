# truffle-plugin-verify

This truffle plugin allwos you to automatically verify your smart contracts source code on Etherscan, straight from the Truffle CLI.

## Installation
1. Install the package
```sh
npm install truffle-plugin-verify
```
2. Add the plugin to your `truffle.js` or `truffle-config.js`
```js
module.exports = {
  /* ... rest of truffle-config */

  plugins: [
    "truffle-plugin-verify"
  ]
}
```
3. Generate an API Key on your Etherscan account (see the Etherscan website)
4. Add your Etherscan API key to your truffle config (use something like `dotenv` to make sure you don't commit the api key)
```js
module.exports = {
  /* ... rest of truffle-config */

  verify: {
    etherscanApiKey: 'MY_API_KEY'
  }
}
```

## Usage
```
truffle run verify SmartContractName [--network networkName]
```

For example, if we defined `rinkeby` as network in Truffle, and we wish to verify the `SimpleStorage` contract:

```
truffle run verify SimpleStorage --network rinkeby
```

This will return a `guid` which can be checked to see if the verification succeeded. This will be automated in a future release.

```

## Limitations & Roadmap
This plugin is in a very early version, so there is still a lot missing. Below is a non-exhaustive list of features that are currently missing from the plugin, that will be added in a later release.

* The plugin only works with single file contracts (i.e. no import flattening)
* The plugin has no external library support
* The plugin has no constructor arguments support
* The plugin assumes compiler optimisation has been used
* The plugin has no graceful error handling, so be sure to follow the usage exactly
* The plugin currently only supports mainnet and rinkeby
* The plugin assumes it can find build artifacts under the `build/contracts/` directory (i.e. no support for custom paths)
* The plugin has no support to automatically check the verification status back from Etherscan

## Support
I need funding to develop this plugin to its full potential. If you found this plugin and can't wait for the above features to be completed as well, send me some Îž or tokens at `0x6775f0Ee4E63983501DBE7b0385bF84DBd36D69B` and tweet me [@RoscoKalis](https://twitter.com/RoscoKalis) to let me know what you want your money to go towards.
